# Edge cases: Commands for packs not yet implemented
#
# These commands would ideally be blocked by future packs (containers, kubernetes).
# They are included here to ensure they don't cause crashes and to document
# intended future behavior.
#
# When packs are implemented, move these to true_positives with appropriate rule_ids.
