//! Test helper utilities for pack unit testing.
//!
//! This module provides reusable assertion functions and utilities for testing
//! pack patterns. Use these helpers to ensure consistent test structure and
//! informative failure messages across all pack tests.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::packs::test_helpers::*;
//!
//! #[test]
//! fn test_my_pack() {
//!     let pack = my_pack::create_pack();
//!
//!     // Test destructive patterns block with expected reasons
//!     assert_blocks(&pack, "dangerous-command", "expected reason substring");
//!
//!     // Test safe patterns allow commands
//!     assert_allows(&pack, "safe-command");
//!
//!     // Test unrelated commands are not matched
//!     assert_no_match(&pack, "unrelated-command");
//! }
//! ```
